In addition, advancements in supplement formulations and increasing consumer awareness of the benefits of maintaining muscle health have contributed to the market's growth. The market is expected to continue expanding, especially in regions with a significant aging demographic, such as North America and Europe. Furthermore, the growing trend toward preventive healthcare and the adoption of personalized nutrition plans is expected to drive further opportunities within the market, offering substantial growth prospects in the coming years.
